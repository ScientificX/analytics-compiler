/**
  * A market-data snapshot: the set of market objects a pricing function needs,
  * each addressed by a [[RiskFactorKey]]. The key's `KeyType` determines which
  * collection holds the object (curve vs surface vs vector vs spot vs matrix).
  *
  * For curves there are two related maps:
  *   - `curveQuotes` — the *input*: the par instruments whose quotes the curve
  *     is bootstrapped from. This is what a shock transforms (par-conversion).
  *   - `curves` — the *derived* result: the bootstrapped (or flat) curve.
  *
  * A scenario is a transformation of this snapshot; the snapshot is immutable
  * and updated via the `with*` copy methods.
